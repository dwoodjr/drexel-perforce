## üèóÔ∏è Creating Your Workspace

Before you can start working with files, you need to set up your workspace. A workspace is your personal working area where you interact with files from the Perforce server.

### Steps to Create a Workspace:

1. **Open P4V**: Launch the Perforce Visual Client

2. **Connect to the Server**: 
   - If not already connected, go to `Connection > Connect to Server`
   - Enter your server address, username, and password

3. **Create a New Workspace**:
   - Go to `Connection > New Workspace`
   - Or use the shortcut (when inside the Workspaces context window): `Ctrl + N` (Windows) or `Cmd + N` (macOS)

1. **Configure Workspace Settings**:
   - **Name**: Enter a unique name for your workspace (e.g., "Username_ProjectName_Machine")
      - It is recommended to begin all workspaces with your `abc123` username
   - **Root**: Choose a local directory for your workspace files
   - **Stream**: Select the appropriate stream for your project (e.g., "//depot/main")
   - **Description**: Add a brief description of your workspace's purpose

5. **Set Workspace View**:
   - This defines which parts of the depot you want in your workspace
   - *For most users, the default view based on the selected stream is sufficient*

1. **Advanced Options**:
   - Configure options like line-ending settings or submit options as needed
      - Tick on `Modtime` under Advanced tab
      - Tick on `Rmdir` under Advanced tab

7. **Create Workspace**: 
   - Click 'OK' to create your workspace

8. **Initial Sync**:
   - After creating the workspace, you'll be prompted to sync files
   - This downloads the current versions of files to your local workspace

> [!tip] Workspace Naming Convention
> Follow your team's naming convention for workspaces. A common format is "UserName_MachineName_ProjectName".

> [!note] 
> The specific options and appearance may vary slightly depending on your Perforce server configuration and P4V version.

## üõ† Managing .p4ignore Files

> [!important] Why Use .p4ignore?
> `.p4ignore` files help manage which files are versioned in your project. This is crucial for game development, where you often have build directories, temporary files, or third-party libraries that shouldn't be in version control.

### Setting Up .p4ignore Support

1. **Enable .p4ignore Support**:
   - Open Command Prompt as administrator
   - Type `setx P4IGNORE .p4ignore` and press Enter

	- **Alternative Method: Edit System Environment Variables**:
	  - Search your computer for an option to 'Edit the system environment variables'
	  - Under 'System variables', click 'New'
	  - For 'Variable name', enter `P4IGNORE`
	  - For 'Variable value', enter `.p4ignore`
	  - Click 'OK' on all windows to save the changes
	  - Restart any open command prompts or applications for the change to take effect


2. **Create a .p4ignore File**:
   - In your workspace root, create a file named `.p4ignore`
   - Add patterns for files to ignore, for example:

```plaintext
# Ignore temporary files
*.tmp

# Ignore build directory
build/

# Ignore all files in temp directories
temp/**
```

> [!tip] Pro Tip - .p4ignore File
> For Unity or Unreal projects, check if a template `.p4ignore` file is provided in your depot. It's a great starting point! If not, we provide a default [Universal .p4ignore](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AqQzGx8l4o2wk-gX4KcMQCz_Dz8SjA?e=fZIpeN) file that can be used for most game design and virtual production projects.
