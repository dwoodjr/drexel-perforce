# Integration of the Bulk Add Tool into P4 Admin

In situations where the Bulk Add or Bulk Project Creator Tool is absent from P4 Admin, it is necessary to engage a Perforce administrator for its inclusion. Alternatively, if possessing the role of a P4 Admin Super User, the tool can be integrated by adhering to the installation instructions detailed in the repository found [here](https://github.com/vertigojc/p4_bulk_project_creator).

**Installation Steps:**
1. **Repository Cloning:** Initiate by cloning the tool's repository to a local directory.
2. **Tool Creation in P4 Admin:**
   - Navigate to `Tools > Manage Tools > Custom Tools...` after logging into P4 Admin with super user credentials.
3. **Tool Registration:**
   - Within the Custom Tools window, opt for `New > Tool...`.
4. **Tool Configuration:**
   - In the ensuing Add Local Tool window, provide the necessary details for:
     - **Name:** Assign a name to the tool.
     - **Application:** Specify the path to the tool's executable file (.exe).
     - **Start In:** Designate the path where the tool's configuration file (.ini) resides.
     - Ensure the option `Refresh Helix Admin upon completion` is selected.
5. **Finalization:**
   - Confirm the settings by clicking `OK`, followed by applying the changes across all dialogue windows.

# Preparing the Project Details CSV

The Bulk Add Tool requires a CSV (comma delimited) file for parsing new users, groups, and depots. This file must adhere to a specific format to facilitate the creation of all new project components. An example CSV can be found here: [good_example_list.xlsx](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AqQzGx8l4o2wk-U7Mr4SqcDrzKJSuQ?e=jYTQVq)
- ### Components Explained
	- **Name**: The student's full name.
	- **Drexel ID/Email**: The student's Drexel email, typically in the format `abc123@drexel.edu`.
	- **Group Name**: A unique identifier for the student group, formatted as `Year_Quarter_ProjectType_GroupName`. Project types are categorized as either Unity (`N_`) or Unreal (`R_`).
	- **Owner**: Indicates the group depot owner. Mark one student (ideally the project lead or lead developer) as the Owner with `TRUE`. This student will have administrative responsibilities for the group's depot. 
		- If a Student is not an owner, leave the cell blank. 
		- It is a good idea to place the Owner as the *first* group member.

| Name         | E-mail                 | Group_Name       | Owner |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| John Doe     | jdoe123@drexel.edu     | 2024_FA_N_GroupA | TRUE  |
| Jane Smith   | jsmith456@drexel.edu   | 2024_FA_N_GroupA |       |
| Mike Brown   | mbrown789@drexel.edu   | 2024_FA_R_GroupB | TRUE  |
| Alex Johnson | ajohnson012@drexel.edu | 2024_FA_R_GroupB |       |

6. **Completion:**
   - Upon successful execution of all tasks, close the tool. Refresh P4 Admin to view the newly added users, groups, and depots.

#  Passwords

By default, the initial password for all users will beÂ `ChangeMe123!`. New users will be required to **reset** their password on first login.

If a new default password is desired, the `config.ini` can be changed to update the default passwords.
```JSON
[DEFAULT]
EMAIL_DOMAIN = myuniversity.edu
DEFAULT_PASSWORD = myUniversitySecret#45
REQUIRE_PASSWORD_RESET = false
```
